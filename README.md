# SecureOpenEHR
A XACML access control system for securing openEHR health records. This implementation currently covers two medical scenarios, but its flexibility allows for further extensions:

* **Medical encounter**: a non-emergency situation where a fictitious hospital delivers care for the hypertensive patient Mr. Scott. The access control mechanism regulates access to the health record (i.e medication list, allergy list, problem list), ensuring healthcare professionals have personalized views of it.
* **Life-threatening accident**: coming soon
